   <h3 style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; color: #913d3d ">version control</h3>
   <div class="a">
   	<p style="color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 22px;">Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.</p>

   <h3 style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; color: #2e7e82">Git and Github</h3>
   <div class="b">
   	<p style="color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 22px;">Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.</p>

   <h3 style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; color: #c2910a">git commands</h3>
   <div class="d">

   <h3 style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; color: #51486e" >git commits</h3>
   	<p style="color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 22px;">The git commit command is one of the core primary functions of Git. Prior use of the git add command is required to select the changes that will be staged for the next commit. Then git commit is used to create a snapshot of the staged changes along a timeline of a Git projects history.</p>
   	<h3 style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; color: #51486e" >git inits</h3>
   	<p style="color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 22px;" >This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.</p>
   	<h3 style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; color: #51486e" >git add</h3>
   	<p style="color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 22px;">Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.</p>
   	<h3 style="font-family: 'Architects Daughter', cursive; color: #51486e" >git status</h3>
   	<p style="color: #f2f2f2; font-size: 22px;">This command returns the current state of the repository.git status will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes itâ€™ll return nothing to commit, working directory clean.</p>
